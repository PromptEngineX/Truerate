# Truerate
This full-stack application provides a critical infrastructure tool for the jewelry industry, offering a single source of truth for dynamic pricing. It integrates with real-time financial APIs to deliver instant, verifiable spot prices for gold, silver, and other elements, directly to both shop-facing and customer-facing interfaces.
Key Features:

Live Data Integration: Fetches and displays real-time spot market data (mention API or data source if public).

Dual Interface: Provides distinct views for shop operators (potentially including margin/cost tools) and end-users (focused on raw metal rates).

Element Tracking: Supports live rate tracking for multiple key elements relevant to jewelry (e.g., Gold (22K, 18K), Silver, Platinum).

Architecture: (Add your actual tech stack here, e.g., React/Vue Frontend, Python/Django Backend, REST API for data).
